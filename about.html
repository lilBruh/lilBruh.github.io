            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <br>
            <p>This is computer science, period 1. In this class we program. My favorite sport is baseball, both watching it and playing it. I also like playing football, soccer and basketball, but out of those three, really just watch football. In baseball my position is shortstop and second base. My favorite baseball team is the Bosten Red Sox and my favorite player is Dustin Pedroia. My favorite football team is the Indianapolous Colts and my favorite player on that team is T.Y Hilton.</p>
